# Customer Churn Prediction - Machine Learning 




## Problem Statement
Customer Churn prediction using machine learning. The objective is to test out various classical machine learning algorithms present in order to predict customer churn accurately. It also tries to exhaustively compare algorithms and the effects of data refining on similar algorithms.

## Introduction and Methodology
Customer churn, also referred to as subscriber churn or logo churn, refers to the proportion of subscribers who terminate their subscriptions and is commonly expressed as a percentage. Customer churn prediction and analysis is one of the foremost and widespread applications of classical machine learning. Customer churn is a critical metric that can display customer satisfaction at the macro scale. Additionally, the telecom sector generally sees more significant churn rates than other sectors. This creates a large-scale requirement for better prediction models. 

For the purpose of training the model, the following was implemented in sequential order: 
- Data cleaning: On checking for duplicate and missing values, we found the data accurate and consistent.  
- Exploratory Data Analysis and Data Preprocessing: Conversion of categorical features to numerical features. Trend analysis of each feature with churn rate (y). Data unit conversion where required. 
- Correlation: Correlation matrix to find linear relationships between two variables. 
- Generalized Linear Model: Relations between predictor variables and response variables devised based on the p-values. 
- Feature Scaling: Used to standardise the independent features within a fixed range. 
- Classification Models
For the three models we have used, the approaches are as follows:
- Binary Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Naive Bayes Classifier
